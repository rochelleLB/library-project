Code Academy "Build a Library" project using classes and inheritance. 

1) Designed a parent class that features all the main components of an item one can borrow from a library - eg: "title", status (is the item available to borrow or checked out?) and rating.
2) Used JavaScript inheritance to design more specific classes for individual items based on the foundations of parent class (eg: book, cd, dvd etc).
3) Populated the library by creating items using instances of the child classes. 
4) Tested the class methods.
